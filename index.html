				<h2>About Me</h2>
					<img class="profile" src="assets/images/jc bus.jpg">

					<p class="text">My name is Jacob Cardillo and I am currently living in Orlando, Fl. I have also lived in California, the Marshall Islands, Oregon, Alabama, Colorado, and Alaska. I graduated from Colorado State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing, and I'm currently enrolled in UCF's coding bootcamp.

					<p class="text">My dream is to travel the world and I am hoping learning how to code can help me accomplish that dream. I want to be able to code remotely from where ever my travels take me. While traveling, I will also be looking to be inspired by what I see and will look for ways to incoporate my inspiration into my work. </p>
